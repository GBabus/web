			      <p>Hi, I am George Babus a math major at Purdue University. My professional interests include Statistics,
			     	Applied Math, and Scientific computing.
				    Outside of class I enjoy outdoor activities like spending time in nature reserves in Indiana or
				  	reading I am currently enjoying The Expanse and The Conservative Sensibility.
		     		When I am back at home, I enjoy spending time with my family most of whom are form Easter Europe.  </p>

						<p>At the risk of being too self-aggrandizing (Hadley Wickham only got a website the year before he
							 started teaching at Stanford) I’d like to maintain this website to showcase some of the projects
							 I am proud of to employers and friends. </p>

						<h2>Projects</h2>
						<p>Personaly I find that a lot of applied math projects deserve more than a github page.
							So I have compiled them in to blog post a few of the most recent ones are down below or click here to see all of them. </p>
